Creating this poster was actually quite fun. The basic background was easy, I literally just took a picture of a piece of paper from my notebook and brightened it. I then overlapped the original image onto a document in Illustrator and traced all of the sketches and the word “community” with the paintbrush tool. I then took a bunch of pictures of my cousins at a family get-together to at least semi-match the look of each of the characters. I then adjusted each image in Photoshop to be exactly what I wanted. Finally I compiled all of it into InDesign and added the credit text at the bottom, which is not something included in the original design.
