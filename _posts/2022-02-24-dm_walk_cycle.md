This is an animated recreation of me walking down a hallway. Very exciting right? An original video of me walking was put into Adobe Animate, and then from their I was able to draw frames on top of the video. My process of creating this was rather messy and not the most effective way to complete this project. I went over every frame (for two steps) and drew every piece of myself in one layer. Using multiple layers likely would’ve been faster and would’ve created an overall better result, but it was a viable way to complete this animation.

This is my walk cycle with a parallax background added. As you can see, the mountains in the background are moving at a different speed than the rest of the ground. The motion tween feature in Adobe Animate allows me to automatically move objects on a line or curve, and the objects are simply moving at different speeds.
