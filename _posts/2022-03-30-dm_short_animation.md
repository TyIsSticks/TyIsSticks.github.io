#  12 Second Animation

This project was more fun than I anticipated it to be. I utilized the different tools in Animate to make the animation much easier to create, such as motion and shape tweens. My Animation is inspired by the David Bowie song Space Oddity, without the slightly brutal ending to the song. Remember to take your protein pills.
