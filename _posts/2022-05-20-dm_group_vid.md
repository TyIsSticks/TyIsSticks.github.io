Our highly intelligent group thought it would be a good idea to make our video us playing Uno in the park. It was that, but it turned out to be far more than that. We went with a Japanese Anime-style of shooting, with close ups that only show about half the subject, and a LOT of effects. Uno-the story will not be coming to any theaters, at least not any of them near you.

Done in a digital media course in high school using the Adobe Premiere.
