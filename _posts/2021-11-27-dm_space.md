Using magic Photoshop tools, I was able to create this interplanetary diorama. The starts in the background were created using the noise tool, creating noise and reshaping portions of that noise to create differently spaced and sized stars. The nebulas were created using an underlying gradient from the top left to the bottom right of the screen, as you may be able to tell by the color transformation from there to there. Using that gradient layer, you are able to paint over the background these cloud-like patterns that form the nebula.

Using these two textures from things around my home, I created the textures of the planets. After defining the images as textures in Photoshop, I made circular shapes filled with these textures and then proceeded to use the spherize tool to made them look more spherical. I then used Photoshop’s glow and shadow tools to create a more three-dimensional looking object, creating the shadow that makes the planets look large and looming.
