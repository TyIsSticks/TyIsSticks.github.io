The photograph piece of this image was created using a simple white rectangle with altered perspective. The left side of the train is simply created using a mask to reveal the other background. To create the effect of the train escaping the photo the original train image is clipped to the rectangle. Assorted effects such as gradients, shadows, and a sepia filter on the photo piece are added for extra effect.
