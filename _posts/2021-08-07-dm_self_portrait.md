Creating this self portrait was tedious work, but the final product turned out great. The process of creating this self portrait started with some basic shapes, and then some base colors. Next I reorganized and properly labeled the layers as seemed fit to match the image. The longest and most important part is adding shadows and highlights to the image. Shadows and highlights are the dark and light spots in an image that make the image look real. Although I didn’t get every single shadow and highlight, there is enough to give my portrait a sense of realism.
